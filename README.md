# Satellite Raspberry
We utilize the massive quantity of open-source satellite data to track and analyze quantitatively how natural stuctures have changed over time. Through image analysis and machine learning platforms we analyze this and present it for you to explore. You can look at specific locations and through Satellite Raspberry track deforestation, climate change effects, and fires. Awareness is the first step to change. This project seeks to help individuals and scientists make educated decisions on nature conservation efforts and first responder action. This issue is of growing importance as the effects of climate change become more severe. We are here to help make a change.

Utilizing Google Earth Engine's massive satellite database with over thirty years of data we strive to help make a change.

We used Google Maps API to implement location specification as well as time-based filtering. Our data was all obtained from the open-source database: NASA EPIC and Google Earth Engine. Our UI was adapted from a template from Creative Tim. We would like to thank Prof. Colleen Lewis for her guidance and support.
